# OpenADMET

OpenADMET is an open-science initiative to advance predictive modeling of ADMET properties (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity).
Small molecules remain a dominant drug modality due to their versatility and flexibility, but their development can be hindered by unpredictable ADMET behavior. OpenADMET aims to address this challenge at scale by integrating:

**Experimental and structural biology:** building understanding of anti-targets

**High-throughput chemistry:** Systematic exploration of chemical space

**AI/ML modeling:** Ligand-based, structural, mechanistic, and physiological models

We aim to drive innovation through open datasets, community challenges, and collaborative tools. Check out our website [here](https://openadmet.org/) or get in touch at openadmet@omsf.io

OpenADMET is a growing consortium, currently involving OMSF, UCSF, Octant, and MSKCC, with funding from ARPA-H, the Gates Foundation, Schr√∂dinger, and the Astera Institute.
